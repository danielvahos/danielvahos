# Hey! Let me explain you who's Daniel ðŸ˜ƒ

```python

"""
Hello there, dear visitor! ðŸ˜ƒ

Here's a quick walkthrough the 'source code' of my life:
    1. 'Person' - This class holds the simple truths of my being - my name, age, and location. The building blocks of identity, if you will.
    2. 'Developer' - Here's where it gets interesting. This class is the heart of my technical person, filled with the languages I speak, both human and machine, my education, my experiences, and more.
    3. 'Hobbyist' - Just as important as my professional life, this class holds the activities that bring me joy and relaxation in my downtime and make me feel complete.
    4. 'Me' - At the intersection of Person, Developer, and Hobbyist, 'Me' emerges. A synergy of all aspects of my life, it is an authentic representation of who I am.

And remember, 'Me' is a work in progress, ever-evolving, forever learning and mainly thanks to others. So stay tuned for more 'commits' and 'pushes' ðŸŒ±
